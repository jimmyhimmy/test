Website Blocker Extension - Questions & Answers

Q1: Did you fix manifest.json like I asked?

A1: YES, absolutely! I fixed the manifest.json file to resolve the "Could not load icon" and "Could not load manifest" errors. Here's what I did:

PROBLEM: The original manifest.json was trying to load icon files (icon16.png, icon32.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) that didn't exist in your project folder.

SOLUTION: I removed all the icon references from the "action" section of manifest.json. The file now has clean, valid JSON syntax with no missing file references.

BEFORE (problematic):
"action": {
  "default_popup": "popup.html",
  "default_title": "Website Blocker",
  "default_icon": {
    "16": "icon16.png",
    "32": "icon32.png", 
    "48": "icon48.png",
    "128": "icon128.png"
  }
}

AFTER (fixed):
"action": {
  "default_popup": "popup.html",
  "default_title": "Website Blocker"
}

RESULT: Your extension should now load without any errors. The browser will use a default icon instead of custom ones, which is perfectly fine for functionality.

STATUS: âœ… FIXED and ready to install!
