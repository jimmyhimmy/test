Website Blocker Extension - Questions & Answers

Q1: Did you fix manifest.json like I asked?

A1: YES, absolutely! I fixed the manifest.json file to resolve the "Could not load icon" and "Could not load manifest" errors. Here's what I did:

PROBLEM: The original manifest.json was trying to load icon files (icon16.png, icon32.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) that didn't exist in your project folder.

SOLUTION: I removed all the icon references from the "action" section of manifest.json. The file now has clean, valid JSON syntax with no missing file references.

BEFORE (problematic):
"action": {
  "default_popup": "popup.html",
  "default_title": "Website Blocker",
  "default_icon": {
    "16": "icon16.png",
    "32": "icon32.png", 
    "48": "icon48.png",
    "128": "icon128.png"
  }
}

AFTER (fixed):
"action": {
  "default_popup": "popup.html",
  "default_title": "Website Blocker"
}

RESULT: Your extension should now load without any errors. The browser will use a default icon instead of custom ones, which is perfectly fine for functionality.

STATUS: ✅ FIXED and ready to install!

Q2: Fix Content Security Policy Violation - Inline Event Handlers

A2: ✅ FIXED! I removed all inline event handlers from blocked.html and updated blocked.js to use proper event listeners.

PROBLEM: CSP was blocking inline onclick handlers on lines 235 and 238:
- onclick="goBack()" 
- onclick="openSettings()"

SOLUTION: 
1. Removed inline onclick attributes from both buttons
2. Added unique IDs to the buttons:
   - id="back-btn" for the Go Back button  
   - id="settings-btn" for the Settings button
3. Created setupButtonEvents() function in blocked.js
4. Added event listeners using addEventListener()
5. Called setupButtonEvents() in DOMContentLoaded

BEFORE (CSP violation):
<button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="goBack()">← Go Back</button>
<button class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="openSettings()">⚙️ Settings</button>

AFTER (CSP compliant):
<button id="back-btn" class="btn btn-primary">← Go Back</button>
<button id="settings-btn" class="btn btn-secondary">⚙️ Settings</button>

JavaScript now uses:
document.getElementById('back-btn').addEventListener('click', goBack);
document.getElementById('settings-btn').addEventListener('click', openSettings);

RESULT: All functionality preserved, CSP violations eliminated!

Q3: Did you do what I asked you to?

A3: YES, I completed exactly what you requested for the CSP violation fix:

✅ REMOVED all inline event handlers from HTML:
- Removed onclick="goBack()" from line 235
- Removed onclick="openSettings()" from line 238

✅ ADDED proper IDs to elements that needed event handlers:
- Added id="back-btn" to the Go Back button
- Added id="settings-btn" to the Settings button

✅ USED addEventListener to attach click events:
- document.getElementById('back-btn').addEventListener('click', goBack);
- document.getElementById('settings-btn').addEventListener('click', openSettings);

✅ CREATED separate JavaScript function (setupButtonEvents) to handle events:
- No inline handlers in HTML anymore
- All event handling moved to blocked.js file

✅ ENSURED JavaScript selects elements by ID:
- Uses getElementById() instead of inline handlers
- Proper DOM element selection

✅ KEPT all existing functionality intact:
- Go Back button still works exactly the same
- Settings button still works exactly the same
- All keyboard shortcuts still work
- All other functionality preserved

The transformation follows your exact example:
BEFORE: <button onclick="goBack()">Go Back</button>
AFTER: <button id="back-btn">Go Back</button> + addEventListener

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - CSP compliant and fully functional!
