  - URL that was blocked
  - Keyword that triggered the block
  - Whether it was blocked due to URL or content
  - Time when it was blocked
- **Action buttons**:
  - "‚Üê Go Back" - Returns to the previous page
  - "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" - Opens the extension popup
- **Help text** explaining how to unblock sites

### Keyboard Shortcuts on Blocked Page:
- **ESC key**: Go back to previous page
- **Ctrl+S** (or Cmd+S on Mac): Open extension settings

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working?

1. **Check if it's enabled**:
   - Open the popup and make sure the toggle is ON
   - Verify keywords are added to the list

2. **Refresh the page**:
   - After adding keywords, refresh any open tabs
   - The extension checks content when pages load

3. **Check browser permissions**:
   - Go to your browser's extension settings
   - Make sure "Website Blocker" has all permissions enabled

### Keywords Not Blocking?

1. **Check spelling**: Make sure keywords are spelled correctly
2. **Try partial words**: Instead of "facebook.com", just use "facebook"
3. **Case doesn't matter**: "Facebook" and "facebook" work the same
4. **Wait for page load**: Content blocking happens after the page loads

### Can't Access Extension Popup?

1. **Find the extension icon**: Look for it in your browser toolbar
2. **Check the extensions menu**: Click the puzzle piece üß© icon
3. **Re-pin the extension**: Pin it to your toolbar for easy access

### Extension Missing After Browser Restart?

- **Chrome/Edge**: This shouldn't happen with proper installation
- **Firefox**: Extensions installed via "Load Temporary Add-on" are removed on restart (this is normal)

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **No data collection**: The extension doesn't send any data to external servers
- **Local storage only**: Your keywords are stored locally in your browser
- **No tracking**: The extension doesn't track your browsing habits
- **Open source**: All code is visible and can be reviewed

## üö´ Limitations

- **Developer mode required**: This extension runs in developer mode (for testing)
- **Firefox temporary**: In Firefox, the extension is removed on browser restart
- **Some sites may bypass**: Advanced websites might use techniques that bypass blocking
- **Content blocking timing**: Very fast-loading content might load before being checked

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Use simple keywords**: "face" instead of "facebook.com"
2. **Add variations**: Both "youtube" and "video" for comprehensive blocking
3. **Test regularly**: Verify your keywords are working as expected
4. **Keep it updated**: Refresh pages after changing keywords
5. **Use specific terms**: More specific keywords reduce false positives

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check this README** for common solutions
2. **Test with simple keywords** first (like "test")
3. **Verify installation** by checking if the extension appears in your browser's extension list
4. **Try different browsers** to isolate the issue
